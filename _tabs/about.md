I'm **Omar Ahmed**, a Security Analyst with a background in **Computer Engineering** and a strong foundation in
networking, system administration, and cybersecurity operations. My work and learning focus on **threat hunting,
malware analysis, and incident response**, supported by hands-on experience with tools like Nmap, Wireshark, Snort,
Sysinternals, Sysmon, and Wazuh.

I’m currently progressing through the **TryHackMe SOC Level 1 path** and preparing for the **CompTIA Security+**
certification, while actively building a home lab to deepen my practical skills in detection, analysis, and system
hardening.

### Professional Experience

In my role as **Junior IT Support**, I have:

- Redesigned complex network topologies into secure, structured architectures  
- Implemented **least privilege models** and segmented networks using VLANs  
- Hardened switch and firewall configurations  
- Built and managed Windows Server services such as **DHCP, Active Directory, and Veeam backups**  
- Developed automation scripts, including PowerShell tools for IT asset inventory  
- Self-hosted and secured internal services such as ticketing and password management systems  

These experiences strengthened my understanding of network security, system hardening, and incident troubleshooting.

### Cybersecurity Experience

I’ve practiced SOC and IR workflows through labs involving:

- Log analysis using **Wazuh, Sysmon, and Windows Event Logs**  
- SIEM investigations and dashboards in **Splunk**  
- Static and behavioral malware analysis using Sysinternals  
- Linux-based security challenges on **OverTheWire**

### Areas of Focus

- Threat Detection & Incident Response  
- Malware Analysis  
- Network Security & Segmentation  
- Linux Administration & Scripting  
- System Hardening & Documentation  

I’m driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and continuous learning, and I aim to contribute to a security team where I
can support monitoring, detection, and response efforts while continuing to grow as a cybersecurity professional.
